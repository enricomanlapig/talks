**Ghanshyam Mehta** gave great grades and showed me that mathematics is about much more than notation

- struggle and beauty: "proving this theorem is like climbing a mountain every step is so painful but the view from the top is truly spectacular"

- knowing something is different to doing something: "what does it mean to solve a problem if you already know that a solution exists? what have you done?"

**Rodney Beard**

- i taught the entire statistics class with venn diagrams.  they have no idea what's happening.

- i wrote a paper about optimal lateness

- crossing a 4-way intersection - you should cross all the way round

- learn latex
